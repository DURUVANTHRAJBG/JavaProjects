Game Setup and Data Structures:

	private static char[][] board = new char[3][3];
	private static char currentPlayer = 'X';
	
We start by declaring a 2D array called board to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. It's a 3x3 grid where players 	will place their 'X' or 'O' marks.

We initialize the currentPlayer variable with 'X'. This variable keeps track of which player's turn it is ('X' or 'O').

main Method:

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    initializeBoard();
	    displayBoard();
    
	    // ... Game logic ...
	}


The main method is the entry point of the program.

We call initializeBoard() to set up the empty Tic-Tac-Toe board and displayBoard() to display it at the beginning of the game.

We then enter a loop that contains the game logic.


initializeBoard Method:

	private static void initializeBoard() {
	    for (int row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
	        for (int col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
	            board[row][col] = ' ';
	        }
	    }
	}


The initializeBoard method initializes the board array with empty spaces (' ') to represent an empty board.


displayBoard Method:

	private static void displayBoard() {
	    System.out.println("-------------");
	    for (int row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
	        System.out.print("| ");
	        for (int col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
	            System.out.print(board[row][col] + " | ");
	        }
	        System.out.println("\n-------------");
	    }
	}


The displayBoard method prints the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board to the console. It iterates through the board array and prints each cell along with vertical and horizontal lines to create the grid.




Game Loop:

		while (!gameOver) {
		    int[] move = getPlayerMove();
		    int row = move[0];
		    int col = move[1];
	    
		    // ... Game logic ...
		}


	The game loop runs until the gameOver variable becomes true. It's responsible for taking player moves and 	checking the game's state.

	Inside the loop, we call getPlayerMove() to get the current player's move (row and column) from the console.


	getPlayerMove Method:
	
	private static int[] getPlayerMove() {
	    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
	    int[] move = new int[2];

	    System.out.print("Player " + currentPlayer + ", enter your move (row and column): ");
	    move[0] = scanner.nextInt();
	    move[1] = scanner.nextInt();

	    return move;
	}


The getPlayerMove method prompts the current player to enter their move by specifying the row and column where they want to place their mark ('X' or 'O').

It uses a Scanner object to read input from the console.

The method returns an array containing the selected row and column.


 Validating and Updating the Board:

	if (isValidMove(row, col)) {
	    board[row][col] = currentPlayer;
	    moves++;
	    displayBoard();
	    gameOver = isGameOver(row, col);
	    currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 'X') ? 'O' : 'X';
	} else {
	    System.out.println("Invalid move. Try again.");
	}

We first check if the move is valid by calling the isValidMove method.

If the move is valid, we update the board array with the current player's mark ('X' or 'O') at the specified row and column. We also increment the moves variable.

We then display the updated board using displayBoard().

We check if the game is over by calling the isGameOver method, passing in the current row and column.

Finally, we toggle the currentPlayer between 'X' and 'O' to switch turns.


Checking for a Game Over Condition:

	private static boolean isGameOver(int row, int col) {
	    return checkRow(row) || checkColumn(col) || checkDiagonals() || checkAntiDiagonals();
	}


kRow(row) || checkColumn(col) || checkDiagonals() || checkAntiDiagonals();
}
The isGameOver method checks if the game has ended by calling several helper methods:

checkRow(row): Checks if the current player has won horizontally in the specified row.
checkColumn(col): Checks if the current player has won vertically in the specified column.
checkDiagonals(): Checks if the current player has won diagonally (from top-left to bottom-right).
checkAntiDiagonals(): Checks if the current player has won diagonally (from top-right to bottom-left).
If any of these conditions are met, the game is considered over, and isGameOver returns true.


Helper Methods for Win Conditions:


	private static boolean checkRow(int row) {
	    return board[row][0] == currentPlayer && board[row][1] == currentPlayer && board[row][2] == currentPlayer;
	}

	private static boolean checkColumn(int col) {
	    return board[0][col] == currentPlayer && board[1][col] == currentPlayer && board[2][col] == currentPlayer;
	}

	private static boolean checkDiagonals() {
	    return board[0][0] == currentPlayer && board[1][1] == currentPlayer && board[2][2] == currentPlayer;
	}

	private static boolean checkAntiDiagonals() {
	    return board[0][2] == currentPlayer && board[1][1] == currentPlayer && board[2][0] == currentPlayer;
	}




These helper methods are used to check for win conditions:

checkRow(int row): Checks if the current player has won in a specific row.
checkColumn(int col): Checks if the current player has won in a specific column.
checkDiagonals(): Checks if the current player has won diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right.
checkAntiDiagonals(): Checks if the current player has won diagonally from the top-right to the bottom-left.
Each method checks if the player's mark ('X' or 'O') occupies all three cells in a particular winning pattern.


End of the Game:

	if (moves == 9 && !gameOver) {
	    System.out.println("It's a draw!");
	    break;
	}

After every move, we check if the game has ended in a draw. If the moves variable reaches 9 (indicating that all cells are filled) and the gameOver flag is still false, the game is declared a draw.
